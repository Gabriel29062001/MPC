# Model Predictive Control Project

The objective of this project is to use all knowledge acquired during the course of Model Predictive Control
to develop a controller for a rocket propeller. During the project we will first develop a linear MPC with the
different subsystems, then track some references and then we will simulate a non linear MPC.
